/*	DIRECTED GRAPHS
 * In this graph type the edge (x,y) and (y,x) 
 * are not equal.
 * Thus the edges have a direction
 * This means the nodes can have a degree in (counting edges coming in)
 * a degree for edges going out,
 * and a total degree counting all edges going in and out.

//need degree in and degree out to represent two directions
